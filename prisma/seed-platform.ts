/**
 * Control-plane provisioning — platform staff, not customers.
 *
 * The `system.*` / `platform.*` namespaces are reserved for the control plane,
 * and `hasPermission` deliberately refuses to satisfy them from a tenant grant:
 * not from `finance.*`, and not even from the global `*` that Super Admin
 * carries. That is what closes the confirmed escalation in
 * PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE § 1.2, where any customer administrator could suspend,
 * export or offboard any other tenant.
 *
 * The consequence is that the control plane ships fail-closed: correct, but
 * unusable, because nothing grants those permissions. This script is the only
 * sanctioned way to grant them.
 *
 * Why a separate script and a reserved tenant:
 *
 *   - `Role.tenantId` is required, so a control-plane role has to live under
 *     some tenant. Putting it under a customer tenant is precisely the
 *     escalation we closed, so it lives under a reserved tenant that is not a
 *     customer: no plan, no trial, no billing, no demo data.
 *   - Keeping it out of `prisma/seed.ts` is enforced, not conventional. The
 *     `control-plane-seeded-to-tenant` policy gate fails the build if a
 *     `system.*`/`platform.*` grant ever appears in the tenant seed.
 *   - No default staff user is created. A well-known platform-staff login with
 *     a shared password would be a backdoor into every tenant's data at once —
 *     strictly worse than the escalation this whole mechanism exists to close.
 *     Staff are provisioned explicitly, by email, via PLATFORM_STAFF_EMAIL.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm --filter @kannan19302/database db:seed:platform
 *   PLATFORM_STAFF_EMAIL=you@example.com pnpm --filter @kannan19302/database db:seed:platform
 *
 * Without PLATFORM_STAFF_EMAIL the roles are created but assigned to nobody,
 * which leaves the control plane closed. That is the intended default.
